# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

For this project I created a report for an investment bank that is offering investment portfolios that include cryptocurrencies. The report includes cryptocurrencies that are trading currently and how they might be grouped to better improve performance. I am using unsupervised machine learning on data provided by CryptoCompare.

## Results

After cleaning up the data to include actively trading cryptocurrencies wtih a defined algorithm and a complete set of data, there were 532 different cryptocurrrencies in the data set. From there I created a three dimisional graph to show how the different cryptocurrencies are grouped together. Each point includes its name as well as the algorithm used to create the currency.

I then created a two dimisional graph to show the relationship between total coin supply and total coins mined to show how each currency compares to the rest. Each point includes its currency name.
